{"name":"Jukebox","tagline":"Sophisticated audio playback for the web.","body":"\r\nZynga's Jukebox (v1.0)\r\n======================\r\n\r\nThe Jukebox is a component for playing sounds and music with the usage of sprites with a special\r\nfocus on performance and cross-device deployment. It is known to run even on Android 1.6+ devices\r\nand needs very few resources compared to other solutions on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Targets low-end devices and mobile platforms\r\n* HTML5 Audio\r\n* Flash Audio as fallback (support for Android 1.6)\r\n* Sound-Spritemap Entries for easier playback\r\n* Multiple Jukeboxes for parallel playback\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Jukebox Manager adds the following features:**\r\n\r\n* Codec Detection\r\n* Feature Detection\r\n* Automatic Work Delegation for busy Jukeboxes\r\n* Automatic Stream Correction (useful for slow implementations)\r\n* Automatic Looping for Sound-Spritemap entries\r\n* Playback of Background Music\r\n\r\n**Using Jukebox without Jukebox Manager:**\r\n\r\nIt is not recommended to use Jukebox without the Jukebox Manager, but it's still possible.\r\nThe Jukebox Manager offers Codec and Feature detection - to determine which kind of audio codecs will playback properly\r\nin your environment. If you want to still use Jukebox without Jukebox Manager, you will have to set *resources* to\r\nan Array containing only one resource.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpcoming Features\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n* Dynamic balancing of free clones at runtime\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThere's a huge [documentation of Jukebox](http://zynga.github.com/jukebox/) available at github pages.\r\nYou are invited to read it, there are also many try-it-yourself demos.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is also attached in the /doc folder if you clone the git repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues (iOS)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\niOS has a huge delay when using an encoded format for playback. That's because of their iTunes-using implementation.\r\nYou can fix these delays using an AIFF container with IMA4 encoding. These are called *Core Audio Files* then.\r\n\r\nAlso, the music spritemap will continue playback if the display is turned off and the JavaScript runtime was stopped.\r\nThis is a known issue and is reported to the iOS developers. Additionally, iOS' security model prevents a website from\r\nplaying sounds without prior user interaction.\r\n\r\nFurther there is only the capability of playing back one sound in parallel on iOS.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at both the [iOS demo](http://zynga.github.com/jukebox/demo/ios.html) and the\r\n[iOS AIFF demo](http://zynga.github.com/jukebox/demo/ios-aiff.html) to see the difference in playback latencies and to\r\nfind out how you can solve all these issues with sound on iOS.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
